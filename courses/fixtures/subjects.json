    "description": "There is no quick answer to this. Safeguarding is an umbrella term used to describe all the things that are done around children, young people and adults at risk to ensure they stay safe from neglect, abuse or harm. \r\nThis is things like knowing the people you care for, educate, teach an out of school class to, dance, martial art, drama...\r\nIf in care, do they have a care plan FYI they should! What does this say about the person. What do they like, what don't they like, what can they do for themselves, what do they need help with, can they eat, drink, go to the bathroom, what level of support do they need? These are just some things you should know. If you get something wrong it could lead to the person sustaining an injury, lead them to choke, get more care then they need, or not enough care they need. These elements all form part of safeguarding. \r\nIf working in education, they will possibly have a pastual support plan. This will indicate levels of support needed in the education environment to enable them to access their learning in the most effective way. \r\nDo the young people have specific risk assessments. How are they followed, reviewed,  and kept up to date and relevant. If any information is missing it could lead to an incident which could lead to a safeguarding concern. \r\nSafeguarding is everything we/you do to ensure children, young people and adults at risk staybsafe from harm, identifying when things go wrong, and what safety measures can be put in place to prevent recurrence of the same issue. \r\nSafeguarding is knowing the children, young people or adult at risk and noticing changes in behaviour. Reporting injuries that are not explained but also recording injuries that are explained so they don't become a potential safeguarding concern. \r\nSafeguarding: everything done to look after the people we care for\r\nSafeguarding concern: reporting things when gone wrong",

By Safeguarding the people they work with they are being proactive in preventing harm.\r\nIf you suspect it report it. Think what if im right, not what if I'm wrong! \r\nBetter to report it and it turn out to be nothing than not report it and turn out to be something. Remember what you are seeing or reportingay only be a small part of a much bigger puzzle and yours is the missing piece. \r\nThere should be a responsible person for safeguarding where you are working- this person will likely be known as the DSL (DESIGNATED SAFEGUARDING LEAD) or Safeguarding Lead, Head of safeguarding, or something similar. This person is responsible for the managing of safeguarding concerns, however it is everyone's job to safeguard the people they work with. Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility.",

    "description": "Mental health is the state in which our mental health is functioning. Some people have good mental health whilst some people do not. Poor mental health can affect any person at anytime in their life. This could be a reaction or chemical response to a specific event in their life or it could be a build of smaller events of a period of time. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the above is paramount to building awareness and removing social stigma for those who experience poor mental health. \r\n\r\nWhen people hear the term mental health there is an automatic assumption this is relating to someone experiencing poor mental health however, just like physical health, and when we talk about that, we don't just discuss it when it's bad, we discuss it when it's good and how we can prevent it from getting bad. The same needs to happen for your mental health. As the age old saying goes prevention is better than cure.\r\nThere are many factors that can impact our mental health both in positively and negatively and it is vital we understand what these are. For each person they can be different but there are some things which are constant in impacting.\r\n\r\nSome factors for positive mental health can be\r\n• Having an outlet, sport, hobby, craft. Something that is just for you.\r\n• Learning to say no. A small but powerful word. Learning to say no can have such a healthy impact on your life both in your private life and your professional life. \r\n• Eating right. There is much evidence to show that eating healthy impacts positively on your mental state. \r\n• Exercise. This generates dopamine which is a feel good hormone. \r\n\r\nSome negative factors include\r\n\r\n• Alcohol- this is a depressant and actually lowers your mood. Block's out thoughts so gives the impression it is helping however all it does it compress the issue or issues someone is facing\r\n• Caffeine- excess caffeine increases the heart rate, this has a negative impact on your anxiety. \r\n• Unhealthy diet - you eat bad you feel bad\r\n• Lack of exercise \r\n• Not creating time for yourself, a hobby, craft, club, class. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease complete below, no more than 500 words, what mental health is and things that impact on this both positively and negatively.......................................................................................................",

    "description": "Well the simple answer is everyone. Every single person on this planet has mental health just like every single person has physical health, and like physical health, mental health can both be Good and bad and varying levels of both. It can also fluctuate. \r\nIt is normal to feel episodes of sadness or worry, it is when these take over your daily life, your capacity to do things, or  impacts upon your thoughts that it becomes poor mental health. \r\nStigma, although not as bad as it once was, still impacts on people with poor mental health. \r\nFor some, when they experience periods of poor mental health this may last a short while and for others it can be a prolonged experience. \r\nIt is important for us all to understand we all have mental health and that we need to care of it and recognise when it may be in need of extra care.\r\nIt is well documented that men are most at risk of taking their own life due to experiencing poor mental health. It is currently the largest cause of death for men under the age of 50. Although a lot of work has been done and continues to be done around removing stigma many men still feel that suffering poor mental health is a sign of weakness, makes them less of a man. This is simply not true. Mental Ill health is NOT a sign of weakness. Because of this feeling men are less likely to seek out support.\r\nFor women with poor mental health they are more likely to seek support from a doctor, counsellor, friend, someone who will listen. This does not mean women are not impacted to the point that they may end their life, it is just that women are better ar seeking support. \r\n\r\nActivity\r\nList 5 things that could be done to reduce social stigma around mental health.\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n4.\r\n5.",

The truth is poor mental health can take many forms and what it looks like doesn't fit one box.\r\nThere are however things you can look out for in loved ones, close friends, colleagues. It could be a change in behaviour, it could be not meeting up with friends or family at the last minute, someone isn't sleeping, someone not taking an interest in things they used to get enjoyment out of, someone having difficulty in concentrating on things, weight gain ,weight loss... \r\nThe above does not automatically mean if someone experiences one or two or even three four of these that they are struggling with their mental health, what these are are some common indicators that people experience when going through a period of poor mental health. \r\nIf you notice a friend, or family member starting to make excuses to not attend social events this can be annoying but rather than stop inviting them or getting annoyed, ask the question - is everything OK? Do you need to talk? I've noticed your not yourself at the minute, anything I can do? You may be surprised by the answer. \r\nIf experiencing poor mental health it is not always easy to open up dialogue with people about this, however, if asked by someone else it can make the start of that dialogue easier, less scary. \r\nRemember if you are struggling there are ways for you to get help. \r\n\r\nSamaritans 116 123\r\nGP\r\nTrained professional \r\nSpeak to a friend or someone you trust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity \r\n\r\nTrue of false \r\n\r\n1.

Please note that what we discuss are only some, more common signs and it is important that there are other indicators so if you suspect something is wrong - talk! \r\n\r\nSomeone who used to enjoy going out, socialising has now started declining invitations. This can be outright but also last minute. This obviously doesn't mean just because someone doesn't fancy going out once or twice is experiencing a decline in their mental health they just may not fancy going out however, keep it in mind and if you think there is a problem create an open, non judgemental safe space to chat. \r\n\r\nA lack of care in appearance and or hygiene. When experiencing a decline in your mental health a person can begin to not take care of themselves. \r\n\r\nExcessive alcohol use or increased use of alcohol. People can sometimes drink as they feel it helps. In truth, alcohol is a depressant. It may feel like it helps as it can act a a blocker however this is not dealing with the issue or issues making you want to drink which then compounds the issue or issues potentially creating the ingredients for a perfect storm. Again, just because fancies the occasional drink does not indicate a problem. \r\n\r\nIf at work you have noticed:\r\n• Someone's performance drop\r\n• Regularly late to work\r\n• Standard of work has dropped off\r\n• Deadlines frequently being missed\r\nThese are just some potential indicators \r\n\r\nSome more urgent signs to look out for.can be people making what could be seen as finalising arrangemts such as\r\n• Getting there affairs in order\r\n• Talking in post humous language such as when I'm gone.\r\n• Appearing to say their goodbyes\r\n• Saying I'm going to take my life or kill myself. There is a  ommon misconception that someone who says it won't do it. This isn't true and needs to be debunked. It.csn be a loud cry for help so offer help, a simple chat. \r\n\r\nPlease note that only ever intervene to help someone if it is safe to do so and never put yourself in danger trying to help someone else. If an emergency always dial 999 before anything. The emergency services don't want to deal with two emergencies. \r\n\r\nActivity \r\n\r\nList 5 signs someone may be experiencing a decline in their mental health. \r\n\r\n1............. \r\n\r\n2............. \r\n\r\n3............. \r\n\r\n4............. \r\n\r\n5.............",

It can also fluctuate. </p>\r\nIt is normal to feel episodes of sadness or worry, it is when these take over your daily life, your capacity to do things, or  impacts upon your thoughts that it becomes poor mental health. \r\nStigma, although not as bad as it once was, still impacts on people with poor mental health. \r\nFor some, when they experience periods of poor mental health this may last a short while and for others it can be a prolonged experience. \r\nIt is important for us all to understand we all have mental health and that we need to care of it and recognise when it may be in need of extra care.\r\nIt is well documented that men are most at risk of taking their own life due to experiencing poor mental health. It is currently the largest cause of death for men under the age of 50. Although a lot of work has been done and continues to be done around removing stigma many men still feel that suffering poor mental health is a sign of weakness, makes them less of a man. This is simply not true. Mental Ill health is NOT a sign of weakness. Because of this feeling men are less likely to seek out support.\r\nFor women with poor mental health they are more likely to seek support from a doctor, counsellor, friend, someone who will listen. This does not mean women are not impacted to the point that they may end their life, it is just that women are better at seeking support. \r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Activity</h6>\r\n<p>List 5 things that could be done to reduce social stigma around mental health.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1.</li>\r\n<li>2.</li>\r\n<li>3.</li>\r\n<li>4.</li>\r\n<li>5.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>"

In this Module we will discuss some possible indicators of some experiencing mental health decline. Please note that what we discuss are only some, more common signs and it is important that there are other indicators so if you suspect something is wrong - talk!</p>\r\n        <b>Someone who used to enjoy going out, socialising has now started declining invitations.</b> \r\n        <p class=\" my-2\">This can be outright but also last minute. This obviously doesn't mean just because someone doesn't fancy going out once or twice is experiencing a decline in their mental health they just may not fancy going out however, keep it in mind and if you think there is a problem create an open, non judgemental safe space to chat. </p>\r\n        <b>A lack of care in appearance and or hygiene.</b>\r\n        <p class=\" my-2\">When experiencing a decline in your mental health a person can begin to not take care of themselves. </p>\r\n        <b>Excessive alcohol use or increased use of alcohol. </b>\r\n        <p class=\" my-2\">People can sometimes drink as they feel it helps. In truth, alcohol is a depressant. It may feel like it helps as it can act a a blocker however this is not dealing with the issue or issues making you want to drink which then compounds the issue or issues potentially creating the ingredients for a perfect storm. Again, just because fancies the occasional drink does not indicate a problem.</p>\r\n        <b>If at work you have noticed</b>\r\n    <ul class=\"list-disc p-6\">\r\n        <li>Someone's performance drop</li>\r\n        <li>Regularly late to work</li>\r\n        <li>Standard of work has dropped off</li>\r\n        <li>Deadlines frequently being missed</li>\r\n        \r\n    </ul>\r\n    <b class=\"my-2\">These are just some potential indicators</b>\r\n    <p class=\" my-2\">Some more urgent signs to look out for.can be people making what could be seen as finalising arrangemts such as</p>\r\n    <ul class=\"list-disc p-6\">\r\n        <li>Getting there affairs in order</li>\r\n        <li>Talking in post humous language such as when I'm gone.</li>\r\n        <li>Appearing to say their goodbyes</li>\r\n        <li>Saying I'm going to take my life or kill myself.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n<div class=\"max-w-sm mx-auto border-dashed border-4 p-4\">There is a  common misconception that someone who says <q>I won't do it</q> will not. </div>\r\n<div class=\" my-4\"> This isn't true and needs to be debunked. It.can be a loud cry for help so offer help, a simple chat. Please note that only ever intervene to help someone if it is safe to do so and never put yourself in danger trying to help someone else. If an emergency always dial 999 before anything. The emergency services don't want to deal with two emergencies. </div>\r\n        <b>Activity List 5 signs someone may be experiencing a decline in their mental health.</b>\r\n        <ul class=\" my-2\">\r\n            <li>1...</li>\r\n            <li>2...</li>\r\n            <li>3...</li>\r\n            <li>4...</li>\r\n            <li>5...</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>"

Safeguarding is an umbrella term used to describe all the things that are done around children, young people and adults at risk to ensure they stay safe from neglect, abuse or harm. This is things like knowing the people you care for, educate, teach an out of school class to, dance, martial art, drama... If in care, do they have a care plan FYI they should! What does this say about the person. What do they like, what don't they like, what can they do for themselves, what do they need help with, can they eat, drink, go to the bathroom, what level of support do they need? These are just some things you should know. If you get something wrong it could lead to the person sustaining an injury, lead them to choke, get more care then they need, or not enough care they need. These elements all form part of safeguarding. If working in education, they will possibly have a pastural support plan. This will indicate levels of support needed in the education environment to enable them to access their learning in the most effective way. Do the young people have specific risk assessments. How are they followed, reviewed,  and kept up to date and relevant. If any information is missing it could lead to an incident which could lead to a safeguarding concern. Safeguarding is everything we/you do to ensure children, young people and adults at risk stay safe from harm, identifying when things go wrong, and what safety measures can be put in place to prevent recurrence of the same issue. Safeguarding is knowing the children, young people or adult at risk and noticing changes in behaviour. Reporting injuries that are not explained but also recording injuries that are explained so they don't become a potential safeguarding concern. Safeguarding: everything done to look after the people we care for Safeguarding concern: reporting things when gone wrong.\r\n       </div>  \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>"

There is a legal obligation placed on people within a position of power to safeguard the people they work with (for reference the term people they work means children,  young people and adults at risk). By Safeguarding the people they work with they are being proactive in preventing harm. If you suspect it report it. Think what if i'm right, not what if I'm wrong! Better to report it and it turn out to be nothing than not report it and turn out to be something. Remember what you are seeing or reportingay only be a small part of a much bigger puzzle and yours is the missing piece. There should be a responsible person for safeguarding where you are working- this person will likely be known as the DSL (DESIGNATED SAFEGUARDING LEAD) or Safeguarding Lead, Head of safeguarding, or something similar. This person is responsible for the managing of safeguarding concerns, however it is everyone's job to safeguard the people they work with. Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility.\r\n       </div>  \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>"

Child protection is what happens when the above has failed or a concern reported needed to be escalated further. Child protection is when a child has come to harm and interventions are now required. Local authorities use models to help establish levels of support. \r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Two common ones are</h1>\r\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 rounded-lg py-5 px-6 mb-4 text-base text-gray-500 \" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.signsofsafety.net/what-is-sofs/\">Signs of safety</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-50 rounded-lg py-5 px-6 mb-4 text-base text-gray-500 \" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.signsofsafety.net/what-is-sofs/\">Family level of need</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n   These models support the local authority in their decision making. Child protection will usually lead to further enquires, strategy meetings and a real focus on how to protect the child from further harm. Strategy meetings will include professionals that have worked with the family, eg health visitor, social worker, teacher, care home manager, police, doctor, and will be chaired by a specialist in this area. However, as this is only an understanding of safeguarding we won't go in to the details of this in this course.\r\n       </div>  \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>"

Protecting people from any form of neglect abuse and harm. \r\n\r\nThe key differences really are; the legislation that feeds in to them. We touched on this earlier in terms of different legislation\r\nChildrens any 2004\r\nKeeping Children Safe in Education \r\nCare Act 2014 \r\n\r\nThere are other legislations however these are key ones. \r\n\r\nIn addition tonreporting concerns to the local authorty which is the same for both adults and children, Childrens safeguarding there is a team called the LADO this stands for local authority Designated officer. This team are notified when a professional is suspected of wrongdoing. There is no LADO for adults. \r\n\r\nThere are more differences however, again, as this is an understanding rather than qualification we won't go in to that here. This would be covered within tour local DSL training and what your local authority wants reporting to them."

They should be free from obstruction so in the event of a fire people can exit the building safely. </p>\r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Noting any scorch/burn marks on plugs and reporting this</h1>\r\n  <p class=\"mb-2\">Scorch marks or burn marks on plugs can indicate there is a fault causing the socket to overheat which could lead to a fire. If you see this. Remove the item and report it to your line manager. </p>\r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Checking bins are emptied regularly </h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">Full bins pose more a a fire hazard than empty bins. This is due to a full bin would give more fuel for the fire to burn.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Visual checks on emergency lighting to ensure it is working</h1>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Checking the fire panel for faults </h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">If a fault is showing report this immediately to your line manager.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Ensuring corridors are free from obstruction</h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">This could cause a delay in getting out the building. Corridors and escape routes should be free from obstruction at all times. </p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">All people in the service should have a PEEP (PERSONAL EMERGENCY EVACUATION PLAN) </h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">This details the specifics for each individual on how they need to be supported to evacuate in the event of an emergency such as a fire.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">All staff should know where the alarm points are and where to evacuate to.</h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">If you don't know where the alarm points are you will not be as quick in raising the alarm if you see a fire. This would cause a delay for everyone needing to evacuate the building.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Fire doors should be kept shut and never propped open. </h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">Fire doors offer approximately thirty minutes of protection form a fire and smoke. This gives people more time to safely evacuate. If propped open they will not shut when the alarm is raised causing the fire and smoke to spread much quicker. </p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Regular alarm tests should be carried out to ensure the alarms are working, and the fire doors that are on an automatic release close.</h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">If any faults noted they must be reported as per your company/organisational policy</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Fire evacuation drills</h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">These are cometed to highlight any areas of concern with evacuating to be addressed so that if you need to evacuate for real then this will be as smooth as possible. Additionally it supports people to get used to what the alarm sounds like and to recognise that they need to evacuate the building.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Checks of fire fighting equipment </h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">These should be checked by a person who is trained to do so. </p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Lighting checks</h1>\r\n  <p class=\" mb-2\">Does the emergency lighting work? If not report it. You need to be able to see where you are going in the event of a fire.</p>\r\n  \r\n</div> \r\n</div>"

Each workplace will have a fire evacuation plan and this can be different in different buildings. Some buildings you may do a horizontal evacuation. This is where, if the fire is in one part of the building and everyone else is in another, providing there are fire doors between you and a fire exit accessible to you, so can move to this part of the building whilst maybe waiting for support to evacuate safely. As a rule though it would be better to get out ASAP if safe to to do so.</div>\r\n         \r\n          <h1 class=\"my-6 font-bold text-center\">The basics though of what actions to take upon seeing a fire are as follows</h1> \r\n          <ul class=\"list-disc p-6 text-lg\">\r\n            <li>Raise the alarm </li>\r\n            <li>If there is a fire door between the fire and yourself you should close this if safe to do so. </li>\r\n            <li>Ensure all on duty know this is not a drill.</li>\r\n            <li>Call the fire and rescue service on 999. Give them the address and make sure they repeat it back to you before you hang up.  </li>\r\n            <li>Once outside take a roll call to ensure everyone is accounted for.</li>\r\n            <li>You must be given the all clear before being able to re-enter the premises.</li>\r\n            \r\n        </ul>\r\n     \r\n    </div> \r\n</div>"

Without knowing this it would be harder to know when our mental health is struggling. Again, there is no one size fits all.</p>\r\n            <p class=\" my-2\">Just because you or someone you know is having a bad day or bad week this does not automatically mean they are having concerns with their mental health as it is a normal emotion to feel down, sad, angry but it is how we deal with those emotions that matters.</p> \r\n            <p class=\" my-2\">You have a hobby, craft, outlet you enjoy and you take part in this regularly. You look after yourself and maintain a healthy diet and eat well. Someone who talks about problems they are having rather than bottling things up and keeping it to themselves. </p> \r\n            <p class=\" my-2\">It spans the wider society and about their understanding, so people like you are helping by undertaking this course. If you are an employer it may be worth championing mindfulness sessions such as relaxation sessions like yoga or meditation. Group reflective supervision where people can share experiences-<b>this should not be confused with counselling sessions</b>  - only a trained qualified professional is able to offer this. Taking part in mental health awareness week. Offering a mental health first aider service. Some employers go even further by offering an in house counselling service for free of charge but this is by no means the majority.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p class=\" my-2\">The benefits to this are reported as reduced employee absence, more productivity, reduced presenterism of poor mental health and better employee retention are but some of the listed benefits. If you are not an employer but an employee where the above are not offered, why not discuss it with the management if you think it is needed. </p> \r\n            <p class=\" my-6 font-bold\"> \r\n                It is important to remember your own behaviour can have an impact on how someone is feeling. \r\n            </p>\r\n                \r\n            <div class=\"max-w-sm mx-auto border rounded overflow-hidden my-12 shadow-md\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../../media/images/betari.png\" alt=\"betari model\">\r\n                <h1 class=\"mt-6 font-bold text-center\">Betari box model</h1>\r\n                <p class=\"p-6\">A tool I like to use to remember this is the Betari box model.

The danger zone is where deadly bacteria begins to breed. \r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">PPE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Aprons and gloves suitable for cooking should be provided by your employer. It is your responsibility to use them. \r\n    Aprons can be either disposable or material. If material they must be washed daily at 90°c \r\n    Disposable Aprons must be disposed of after each use.\r\n    Gloves should be disposable one use only. \r\n    For longer hair a hair net should be worn. If you have a beard then a beard net should be worn. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"my-6 font-bold\">Personal hygiene </h3>\r\n<p>Jewellery should not be worn with the exception of a plain band wedding ring. This should be covered with a blue plaster.\r\n    Any cuts should be covered with a blue plaster.\r\n    If you have suffered an upset stomach - diarrhea or sickness you must not be involved in food Preparation and must stay away from work for at least 48hours from your last bout. \r\n    Hands should be washed before and after handling food.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"
